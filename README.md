# FINANCIAL REVIEW

The dataset has the financial data of 500 companies. The script provides handy ways of converting variables to different data types, using gsub() and sub() functions for replacing a subpart of a data, dealing with missing data, exploring filtering methods, and finally visualizing the data after the cleanse process.

The dataset and methods are taken from Kirill Eremenko's Advanced Analytics In R For Data Science course.
Each line of function is commented and explained in detail by me to better analyze what each action represents.
